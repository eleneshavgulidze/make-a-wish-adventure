	<h1>The third wish</h1>
	<p>Elene realizes that true happines comes from within</p>
	<p>With her third wish, she chooses inner peace. Suddenly, she finds herself surrounded by loved ones, laughing and smiling.</p>
	<p>This moment conveys a powerful message: true fulfillment comes from gratitude and appreciating what we already have. It's not about the wealth but rather the richness of connections and the joy found in simple moments shared with those we cherish</p>
	<p> Never forget to dream big, never forget your little self and do everything for your goals and dreams. "If you can dream it, you can do it!", say thank you everyday to the world for breathing, being alive and you will see how your gratitude come back to you like a boomerang!</p>
