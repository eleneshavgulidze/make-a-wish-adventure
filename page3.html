	<h1>The second wish</h1>
	<p>As Elene wakes up and discovers a mysterious old lamp, she rubs it and genie appears, offering her one wish. Elene wishes for wealth and success, but the genie warns her to be careful what she wishes for. He advises her to explore the consequences of wishing for material wealth without considering the bigger picture.</p>
	<p>This reminds us that true fullfilment comes not just from material abudance, but from a balanced and thoughtful approach to life's desires and aspirations</p>
