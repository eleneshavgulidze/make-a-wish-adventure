	<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
	<p> Meet Elene, a 20-year-old Georgian girl with a heart full of big dreams. She once wished to live in the vibrant streets of New York City, and now she walks them.</p>
	<p> Elene's evenings are spent under the starlit sky, where she lets her dreams take flight. </p>
	<p> Each shooting star she sees becomes a chance to make a wish. On her 20th birthday, she celebrated by wishing for 20 more dreams come true. Through her story, we're reminded of the enchanting power of dreams and the undeniable magic of believing, whether it's upon a star, flickering candle, or dandelion. </p>
