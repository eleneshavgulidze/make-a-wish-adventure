	<h1>The first wish</h1>
	<p>As Elene makes her first wish upon a shooting star - To travel the world - she falls asleep with visions of far-off lands and exciting adventures in her mind. Her wish reflects the importance of daring to dream big, as it opens up endless possibilities and fuels the courage to pursue passions.</p>
	<p> In her story, we see how a single wish can ignite a journey of exploration and discovery, reminding us all to welcome the excitment of dreaming beyond boundaries </p>
